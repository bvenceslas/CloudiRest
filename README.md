# CloudiRest

CloudiRest is an API made with javascript framework helping to upload images in the database through multer and cloudinary.
- Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files
- Cloudinary. Cloudinary is a cloud service that offers a solution to a web application's entire image management pipeline

**Multer** needs three parameters:
- **storage** : where the file will be stored, if you don't want to specify the path, just use {},
- **fileFilter**: which helps to identify of filter the file extensions
- **filename**: describes how will your file be renamed
